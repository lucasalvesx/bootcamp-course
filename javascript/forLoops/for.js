// works just as the While, but instead of TESTING a condition, weÂ´re able to SPECIFY
//how many times we'd like the loop to run

//sytanx:
// for (start; end; change){}
for (i=0; i<2; i++){
    //do something
}

//example:
// we start with i being =1; we end when 1 is less <2. incrementing i by 1 each time
for (var i=1; i<2; i++){
    console.log(i);  
}//the incremetion (i++) runs on this line
// and inside the loop we're logging the variable i
