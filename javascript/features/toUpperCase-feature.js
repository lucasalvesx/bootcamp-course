//Self-explanatory, this feature simply turns a value into its UPPER CASE VERSION
//Model is variable.feature();

var animal = dog;
animal.toUpperCase();
//Output is the string "DOG"

//If i wish to reassign the value of a variable to its upper case version, i should just:
animal = animal.toUpperCase();
//If i request to check the value, then it'd turn into "DOG"

//Same works the other way around, with the toLowerCase feature.
animal = animal.toLowerCase();
